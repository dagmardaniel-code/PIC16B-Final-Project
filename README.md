## PIC16B-Final-Project

#### The Project
In our project, we aimed at trying to predict flight prices using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices

In this project, we did data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, dimension reduction (PCA), and modeling. For our models, we used Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. In the end, our best model was a Neural Network with 6 dense layers using our full dataset and standardized data without dimension reduction. 

In the future, we plan on trying to simplify our model to try to reduce runtime. Additionally, we plan to find more data that captures flight trends across multiple years so that we are able to study seasonal effects on flight prices. 

#### Group Contribution Statement
Dagmar worked on reading the data, data cleaning, and the Neural Network model. Ari worked on feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and the Random Forest model. Jocelynne worked on PCA and the Linear Regression model. For the GitHub repo, Dagmar committed the README file, Ari committed the .ipnyb file, and Jocelynne committed the .py file.
